# 🤖Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

A simple yet interactive rule-based chatbot created using basic Python programming concepts. Ideal for beginners stepping into the world of coding and conversational interfaces.

## 🌟 Project Goal

To develop a console-based chatbot that responds with predefined replies based on the user's input. This project reinforces fundamental concepts like control flow, functions, and user interaction in Python.

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot accepts user inputs such as:

- **"hello"**
- **"how are you"**
- **"bye"**
- **"Something else than "hello","how are you","bye"**
  

And replies accordingly:

- **"Hi there!😊"**
- **"I'm doing great, thanks! How can I help you?"**
- **"Goodbye! 👋 Have a nice day!"**
-  **"Sorry, I didn't understand that."**

All logic is handled through clean and simple **`if-elif`** conditions, encapsulated inside **functions**, and executed within a **loop** to keep the conversation going until the user says goodbye.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Used

- **`if-elif` statements** for decision-making  
- **Functions** for modularity and reuse  
- **Loops** to keep the conversation interactive  
- **Input/output functions** (`input()`, `print()`)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the chatbot code into a file called `chatbot.py`.
3. Run the script in your terminal or code editor:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
